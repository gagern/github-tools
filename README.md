github-tools
============

Small scripts used to interact with github

github-upload.py
----------------

Stand-alone python3 script to upload files as release assets to github.

label-asset.py
----------------

Script to change the labels of release assets.
This is particularly useful since editing the release using the web site
currently seems to loose any labels set via the API.
